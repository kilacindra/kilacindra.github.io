Hello! My name is Kilacindra McCabe, and I am originally from Washington. I am currently studying Computer Science in Boise, Idaho, where I've lived since late 2020. I enjoy the abundant hiking opportunities that surround the area. Beyond academics, I have a deep interest in yoga and music. At the age of 13, I hosted my own radio show at KZUU 90.7 FM, and I became a certified yoga instructor in the fall of 2023.

Should you have any questions, require a copy of my CV, or wish to get in touch, please feel free to email me at [kilacindramccabe@u.boisestate.edu](mailto:kilacindramccabe@u.boisestate.edu).
